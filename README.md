# Laravel Revive

Automatically apply Devanox's default code style for Laravel apps.

Revive is built on top of the following tools:

- TLint: lints Laravel and PHP code for issues not covered by other tools
  - using the default `Devanox` preset
- PHP_CodeSniffer: sniffs issues that can't be fixed automatically
  - using the `Devanox` preset which is mostly PSR1 with some Devanox-specific rules
- PHP CS Fixer: adds custom rules not supported by Laravel Pint
  - `CustomOrderedClassElementsFixer` Devanox-specific order of class elements
- Pint: Laravel's code style rules (with a few Devanox specific customizations)
  - using the default `Laravel` preset with some Devanox-specific rules

You can view a list of the compiled rules and examples of what they do in the [style guide](./style-guide.md).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require devanoxltd/laravel-revive --dev
```

Optionally you can publish a GitHub Actions config:

```bash
./vendor/bin/revive github-actions
```

Or you can publish Husky Hooks:

```bash
./vendor/bin/revive husky-hooks
```

## Usage

To lint everything at once:

```bash
./vendor/bin/revive lint
```

To fix everything at once:

```bash
./vendor/bin/revive fix
```

To revive only files that have uncommitted changes according to Git, you may use the `--dirty` option:

```bash
./vendor/bin/revive lint --dirty
#or
./vendor/bin/revive fix --dirty
```

To view all available commands:

```bash
./vendor/bin/revive
#or
./vendor/bin/revive commands
```

### Usage with Sail

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail php ./vendor/bin/revive
```

Alternatively, Sail has a bin [script](https://github.com/laravel/sail/blob/1.x/bin/sail#L211) that eases the execution of package binaries, so you do the same thing like this:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail bin revive
```

## Customizing

If you need to include or exclude files or directories for each tool you can create a `revive.json` config file in your project root:

```json
{
    "include": [
        "bin",
        "scripts",
        "src",
        "tests"
    ],
    "exclude": [
        "tests/fixtures"
        "**/folderToExclude/**"
    ]
}
```

To run additional scripts as part of Revive first add them to `revive.json` as part of `scripts` separated into `lint` and `fix`.

The key is the name of the command (used with the `--using` flag), and the value is an array of arguments passed to [`Symfony\Component\Process\Process`](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/process.html).

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "lint": {
            "phpstan": ["./vendor/bin/phpstan", "analyse"]
        }
    },
    "processTimeout": 120
}
```

Revive will pick these up automatically when running either `lint` or `fix`.
By default, additional scripts timeout after 60 seconds. You can overwrite this setting using the `processTimeout` key.

To customize which tools Revive runs, or the order in which they are executed you can use the `--using` flag and supply a comma-separated list of commands:

```bash
./vendor/bin/revive lint --using="phpstan,tlint,pint"
```

### TLint

Create a `tlint.json` file in your project root. Learn more in the [TLint documentation](https://github.com/tighten/tlint#configuration).

### PHP_CodeSniffer

Create a `.phpcs.xml.dist` file in your project root with the following:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<ruleset>
    <file>app</file>
    <file>config</file>
    <file>database</file>
    <file>public</file>
    <file>resources</file>
    <file>routes</file>
    <file>tests</file>

    <rule ref="Devanox"/>
</ruleset>
```

Now you can add customizations below the `<rule ref="Devanox"/>` line or even disable the Devanox rule to use your own ruleset. Learn more in this [introductory article](https://ncona.com/2012/12/creating-your-own-phpcs-standard/).

### PHP CS Fixer

Create a `.php-cs-fixer.dist.php` file in your project root with the contents from [Revive's `.php-cs-fixer.dist.php`](standards/.php-cs-fixer.dist.php) file. Learn more in the [PHP CS Fixer documentation](https://cs.symfony.com/doc/config.html).

### Pint

Create a `pint.json` file in your project root, you can use [Revive's `pint.json`](standards/pint.json) file as a starting point. Learn more in the [Pint documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/pint#configuring-pint).

## GitHub Action

There's a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/devanoxltd/revive-action) you use to clean-up your workflows.

>**Warning** Heads Up! Workflows that commit to your repo will stop any currently running workflows and not trigger another workflow run.

One solution is to run your other workflows after Revive has completed by updating the trigger on those workflows:

```yml
on:
  # Commits made in Revive Fix will not trigger any workflows
  # This workflow is configured to run after Revive finishes
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Revive Fix"]
    types:
      - completed
```
